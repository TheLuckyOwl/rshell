# rshell

This project is a terminal shell application. It takes input from the user and executes commands appropriately depending on the present operators and connectors. So far we've implemented connectors, commands, built-ins, and precedence operators. To run the program follow the steps below:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, clone the project by using git clone:

git clone https://github.com/TheLuckyOwl/rshell.git

Next, move into the directory:

cd rshell

Checkout the most recent release, which in this case is hw3:
git checkout hw3

Make the program:

make

Finally, run the executable inside the bin folder:

bin/rshell

A comprehensive list of known bugs will be listed below:

-When running echo in a shell script the program will return that there is a unexpected token coming before or after the parantheses.
