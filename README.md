# rshell

This project is a terminal ran project. It takes input from the users and then executes command with passed arguments just like terminal would. It also takes in the host information and current user to display both values on the screen. Some of our known bugs that we have come across are:

-If a connector is present in quotation marks, the program will read it instead of passing it as a argument.(For example in an echo call)
-Quotation marks aren't removed when passing an argument to echo.
